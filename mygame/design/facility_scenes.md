# Facility → Cinematic CYOA — conversion plan (living doc)

The facility is being converted from a timer-driven random-message cycle into **choice-driven,
stateful, cinematic scenes** on the `bx_*` model (see `world/cyoa.py`, Bethany's Intake — the
built reference). This doc is the master list of everything to convert.

## Rules (decided)
- **Everything converts to scenes** — EXCEPT genuine cycles (below), which stay loops.
- **`Continue` is a valid one-option beat.** Linear, non-branching moments still advance on the
  player's click, never a timer. (Add a `continue` option → `then` next beat.)
- **Player-paced.** A scene poses and WAITS on `choose`; `escape`/`forceclear` end it always (§0).
- **Stateful + memory.** Beats read `scene_flags` + real char state and reference earlier choices.
- **Real effects only.** Each choice routes through the real systems (breeding/conditioning/
  marks/drugs/compliance/etc.) — never narrated-only.
- **Present actors.** Every scene has a named NPC who drives it, speaks, reacts, and remembers.
- **Scene flow replaces the room-cycle.** Instead of being dragged room→room on a clock, a scene
  ends and OFFERS the next (move, submit, be taken) as choices / consequences.

## STAYS A CYCLE (not converted)
- **Milking fluid-bank loop** (`_do_milk`) — ongoing extraction for the bank.
- **Engorgement leash** (`_engorgement_tick` / `_engorge_leak`) — passive dairy pressure.
- **Device/machine loops** — milking machine, the breeding/breaking machine, rocking horse,
  Spiral Chair session timer (self-releasing furniture stays mechanical).
- **Passive body ticks** — arousal/stim decay, perpetual-heat upkeep.
*(These remain loops; scenes can START them or hand off INTO them.)*

## A. ROOM SCENES (one+ per facility room; the room's actor drives it)

| Room | Actor(s) | The scene | Real systems it drives |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Intake** | Bethany | ✅ **BUILT** (`bx_*`, 10 beats) | contract/clause, devote, name-forfeit, first-use |
| **Holding** | a holding handler | ✅ **BUILT** (`hd_*`, 4 beats; the dread-of-waiting + first inventory) | catalogue/prep, state-aware |
| **Processing Floor** | a floor handler | ✅ **BUILT** (`pf_*`, 4 beats; processed-in-public + routing) | real `_scene_single` use; the routing hand-off |
| **Breeding Pens** | the **stockman** + named studs + animals | ✅ **BUILT** (`bp_*`, 8 beats; stud/pack/machine branches) | `_gang`/`_scene_knottrain`, lineage, quota |

| **The Records Hall** | Bethany / processor | ✅ **BUILT** (`rh_*`, 4 beats; inspection day, the real grade verdict) | real `grade_reveal` (processing_tier + appraisal off your file) |

---

## B. ENCOUNTER / SYSTEM SCENES (state- or choice-triggered, not room-locked)

- **Breeding variations (13)** *(pigsty/sanitation now demo the reusable `_state_tags` hook)* — each `_scene_*` becomes a cinematic breeding scene (single, oral,
  double, all-holes, bukkake, golden, offspring-breeds-you, spitroast, suspension, knot-train,
  fist, verbal-degradation, prolapse). Stockman/studs/Bethany drive; real `_gang`/insemination.
- **Procedures (≈21)** — the Parlour/surgery scenes, each `_proc_*`: pierce, brand, stim-implant,
  ring-fit, milk-port, one-way, cow-set, tail, fertility-implant, womb-tattoo, clit-hood,
  tongue-split, corset, clit-pump, neuter, sissify, tongue, latex, udder, rings, nugget. Real mods.
- ✅ **Dosing (`dz_*`, `scene dosing`)** — BUILT. The dose administered, the come-up, riding
  the effect; real `_dose` fires an actual drug from your pool. State-aware. In the hub.
- **Conditioning / hypno** — the Spiral Chair induction as full cinematic (settle→spiral→drone→
  deep→set→below); mantra-seating and the descent door as choices. Real triggers/regression.
- ✅ **Punishment / correction (`pn_*`, `scene correction`)** — BUILT. Confess/deny/silent →
  sentence (sty `filth` / floor `make_example` / line `punish`) → aftermath (thank=earn-back
  `gratitude` / refuse=review resets). Real punishment + earn-back. Bethany's disappointed register.
- ✅ **The Fellow arc (`fl_*`, `scene fellow`)** — BUILT. The tragic-intimate set-piece: your
  real continuity fellow (world.facility_fellow) is converted to futa at Bethany's direction
  (real `mark_fellow_futa`), dosed to a rut, and made to breed you as her mind fragments —
  real `company_use` (fellow-sired insemination + `fellow_cross_record`, lines crossed for
  good). State-aware (both-little framing). The bond is the handle AND the one mercy; §0
  floor kept lit for both of you. Branches: fear/brace/reach, watch/look-away, comfort/
  horror, take-her/hold-her, keep-her/grieve-her.
- ✅ **Seraphine's visit (`se_*`, `scene seraphine`)** — the facility↔post-office peerage; Seraphine
  as buyer; the only one Bethany opens to; the laced cum that can't own her; unbirthing carry-home.
  Real `seraphine_takes` ownership transfer. See design/seraphine_bethany.md.
- **Auction → Kept arc** — appraisal/block/gavel → Bethany buys → her evening/bed/morning →
  company (she sends for the fellow). Real ownership, laced devotion, the file.
- ✅ **The Carry (`pg_*`, `scene carry`)** — BUILT. The nested-passenger transfer: ride inside
  Seraphine, brought to Bethany; her womb (→ covered in Bethany's laced load) or her balls (→
  planted INTO Bethany). Real `world.passenger` (board/transfer/cover/eject) + the cum-effect
  rulings. §0 ejects from any host. See design/seraphine_bethany.md §7.
- **Lineage loop** — your get mature into stock and are bred back to you; each delivery raises quota.
- ✅ **The Fitting (`ft_*`, `scene fitting`)** — the most COMBINATION-aware scene: reads the full
  `_kit` (piercings / milk-port / gape-rings / latex / tail / brands / collar / clauses / body-
  states) and the prose AND the real effect change with every piece worn. A bare body gets a
  short scene; a fully-kitted one gets the works (port drained while gape filled while stim rides
  while latex sweats). New reusable `_kit(character)` + `_kit_inventory()` readers — the hook for
  item/piercing/port/state branching across ALL scenes from here.
- ✅ **The Programming (`pr_*`, `scene programming`/trigger)** — BUILT. Installed-trigger
  conditioning — the psychological register the Cell only opens. A phrase is drilled in under the
  headphones until it seats permanent, and then ANYONE who speaks it fires the conditioned response
  (kneel / present / leak). Routes through a new `program_trigger` effect (real
  `binding_effects.install_trigger` → `installed_triggers`, checked on all speech) + conditioning +
  suggestibility (so the next seat bites deeper). arrival → drill → after; you pick your leash-word,
  let it seat or resist (seats anyway, shallower). The dread is the open file — anyone who reads it
  holds the lever. Clean register. Surfaces in the hub by the Conditioning Cell.
- ✅ **The Whelping (`bi_*`, `scene whelping`/birth/labor)** — BUILT. Labor and birth — the breeding
  payoff the pregnancy system never dramatized. She labors and delivers her litter in the birthing
  room, and the REAL `give_birth` effect (`pregnancy.deliver`) births the recorded offspring into
  the lineage, raises that species' quota, and brings her milk in. arrival → labor → after
  (work-with vs fight; bear-down vs endure). State-aware (little/nugget). Closes the loop with the
  Lineage Hall — "the line folds back on itself." Surfaces in the hub when you're carrying.
- ✅ **The Outfitting (`ou_*`, `scene outfitting`/equip/outfit)** — BUILT. Installing the productive
  livestock hardware — distinct from the Marking Parlour (marks/brands/ink) and the Fitting (services
  existing kit): the Outfitting Bay *equips* you, fitting the working hardware that turns a person
  into a producing unit. Combination-aware install menu offers only what you don't already wear
  (milk-port / fertility implant / stim implant / full cow-ring set / locked tail), each routing the
  REAL procedure (`_proc_milk_port`/`_proc_fertility_implant`/`_proc_stim_implant`/`_proc_cowset`/
  `_proc_tail`). arrival → fit → after, with a chart of boxes "always one left to tick." Clean
  register. Surfaces in the hub by the Refinement Suite.
- ✅ **The Refinement (`fm_*`, `scene refinement`/sissify/geld)** — BUILT. Feminization / gelding
  as a set-piece (the real `neutered`/`sissified` procedures had no scene driving them). Bethany has
  you redesigned in the Refinement Suite: gelded and caged (retired stud → leaking locked nub) or
  feminized into a kept sissy (renamed, posed, girly speech-filtered, chastity). Routes through the
  REAL `_proc_neuter` and `_proc_sissify` facility procedures (real flags, chastity, body-mods, name
  drift, the "good girl"→leak trigger, conditioning, marks). arrival → work → after. State/kit-aware
  (re-refines the already-done). Warm-cruel "not diminished — *decided*" register, clean prose.
  Surfaces in the hub by the Marking Parlour.
- ✅ **The Long Milking (`mm_*`, `scene longmilking`/dairyintensive/marathon)** — BUILT. Lactation
  as a savor-piece — the deep version of the Dairy seam: hooked to the deep rig for a full session,
  kept full on purpose, then drawn down slow and all the way, let to fill, drawn down again, cycle
  after cycle. The relief-trap laid thorough — *full is pain, the machine is relief* wired in until
  you present your chest before you're asked. Real `_do_milk`. State-aware (preg yields more / nugget
  cradled / little), kit-aware (milk-port plumbed direct). Producer register, clean prose. Surfaces
  in the hub by the Dairy.
- ✅ **Letters at the Counter (`sl_*`, `scene seraphinelore`/seralore/counter)** — BUILT.
  Seraphine's-side lore, the warm post-office counterpart to Bethany's Pillow Talk: after the OPEN
  sign's turned, the collector turns confiding and you can ask her about the peerage (the one person
  she can't collect and doesn't want to), why she collects (the unclaimed-letter fear), what it's
  like to be immune to the DEVOTION (the lonely clarity of the un-doseable), the 3 a.m. drawer, the
  unsent letters, and what she's read in you. Looping menu, warm register, canon. Real devote/deepen.
- ✅ **The Edge (`ed_*`, `scene edge`/edging/denial)** — BUILT. Orgasm denial / edging as its own
  set-piece (a core facility mechanic that had no dedicated scene): strapped to the edging station,
  walked up to the EDGE bar and HELD there — minutes, hours — never over. The slow-torment register.
  Routes through real `edge_set` (orgasm_denial + raised arousal_floor + banked arousal),
  `deny_hold`, and `grant_relief` (a granted release that deepens the leash — relief becomes a thing
  you beg for, never take). arrival → ride → after. Kit-aware (stim stacks, heat-tell betrays,
  already-denied formalised). Begging gets you over but wires the leash; holding out deepens the
  denial and drags your baseline toward the brink. Surfaces in the hub by the Dispensary.
- ✅ **Between Two Owners (`tw_*`, `scene twoowners`/shared/peers)** — BUILT. The peerage live:
  Bethany and Seraphine share you for an evening, trading you like equals trade a fine bottle. The
  whole point is the CONTRAST — Bethany's laced DEVOTION breeding (real `bethany_breeds`) running
  side by side with Seraphine's immune, un-laced, *personal* warmth (`devote`/`deepen`): the dread
  isn't the dose, it's reaching for Seraphine sober, "with nothing in your blood to blame." arrival
  → shared → after. State/kit-aware. §0 lit by the honest one: "two of us owning you doesn't double
  the lock — there's still just the one door, and it opens on your word past both of us." Surfaces
  in the hub beside the Seraphine route.
- ✅ **The Claiming (`cl_*`, `scene claiming`/claim/brandme)** — BUILT. The persona-central moment
  (§7 canon): Bethany brands you with her own |wB|n, by her own hand, over a brazier — warm-
  possessive, false-tender, watching your face as the iron goes down. Routes through a new
  `bethany_brand` effect (REAL ownership: bethany_owned + title claim mirroring _mark_owned;
  bethany_branded; and a real freeform mark via `record_mark` that shows in marks/brands/look).
  arrival → brand → after. State-aware (re-marks the already-branded). §0 lit over the most
  *permanent* thing she does: "the B is forever — the door is not; I mark you forever and free you
  on a breath, both." Offered in the hub until her B is on you.
- ✅ **The Pod (`pd_*`, `scene pod`/podbank)** — BUILT. Deep Stock *experienced*, not merely
  contemplated (ds_ contemplates; this seals you in): plumbed into a breeding-pod in the deep bank
  — feed-line, breed-line, milk-lines, warm gel, sealed door — and kept indefinitely as the
  deepest stock there is. Routes through a new `go_pod` effect (total_dependence +
  body_processing_locked + navigation_locked + lactation_locked + optional hood — all
  FACILITY_FLAGS) plus real go_cumflate (the breed-line floods you on seal) / deepen. arrival →
  seal → kept. §0 lit BRIGHTEST here, by design: from the very bottom, sealed and suspended, the
  word drains the gel and lifts you out a person at once — "nobody's ever truly kept, especially
  the deep stock." Surfaces in the hub beside Deep Stock.
- ✅ **The Lineage Hall (`lh_*`, `scene lineage`/studbook/brood)** — BUILT. Lore-rich + savorable:
  Bethany walks you through the facility's stud-book of YOUR get, the prose generated LIVE from the
  real offspring data (`studbook_lines`: counts / by-sire / by-sex / generational depth / fellow-
  crossed lines). A barren body reads a blank page she's itching to fill; a productive one is
  paraded its whole lengthening, self-folding line (daughters → broodstock, sons/futa sire back
  into you). Real `bethany_breeds` offered to extend the line over the open book on the spot. §0
  lit: the line is permanent but your *part* in it ends the instant you mean the word — "a source
  can always shut off." Surfaces in the hub beside Records.
- ✅ **The Showing Gala (`ev_gala`, `scene gala`/showing)** — BUILT. A marquee savor-event (pool
  now 6): the facility's black-tie collectors' gala — finest stock oiled and shown on a lit stage,
  demonstrated for a room of moneyed collectors over champagne, then handled at the front tables
  after. Real `_appraise` + `_scene_single`. State-aware (preg = the prize draw / nugget on a
  plinth / little 'shows' sweet). Bethany watches from a booth and collects you at the close —
  "shown, never sold; I keep you so I can lend the world a look and never the rest." §0 lit: the
  word ends the gala and walks you off the stage at once.
- ✅ **The Rut (`ev_rut`, `scene rut`/frenzy/heat)** — BUILT. A marquee savor-event in the random
  dispatcher pool (now 5): the facility's seasonal frenzy — heat-dose run through the floor's air,
  pens thrown open, the whole hall dissolving into one red-lit writhing breeding-mass with no
  schedule, only rut. Real `_scene_allholes`. State-aware (preg/nugget/little), three opening
  routes (give in / ride the edge / fight toward a chosen body). §0 lit: a `the_word_rut` branch
  pulls you clean out of the frenzy at once — "the floor's frenzy can't touch the floor beneath it."
- ✅ **Events (`ev_*`, `scene events`)** — BUILT (4 to start, random dispatcher for freshness):
  the Buyer's Tour (real `_scene_single` + market interest), Quota Day (public tally; real
  `punish` on shortfall / climbing-bar), the Breeding Festival (real `_scene_bukkake` mass
  use), the Anniversary (Bethany's kept-dates; real `bethany_breeds` deepening claim). The
  freshness valve — more events drop into `_EVENT_OPENINGS` over time. In the hub.
- ✅ **Manumission (`mn_*`, `scene manumission`)** — BUILT. The IN-FICTION earned door (NOT the
  §0 floor): reads/drives the real release.py (terms / _unmet / petition / grant). Gated on
  scrip + standing + a LOW devotion cap ("you have to want it less than you do" — the wall
  Bethany works against). The two-doors contrast kept explicit throughout: her hard earned
  door vs the always-free §0 floor. Earned+press -> real grant (or earn-it-then-stay-freely).
- ✅ **The Rig / bondage (`bd_*`, `scene bondage`/rig/suspension)** — BUILT. Core-list bondage:
  strung up in the suspension rig — wrists, ankles, throat, spread and fixed — and kept helpless
  and used. Routes through a new `go_bound` effect (REAL navigation_locked + self_cmds_locked +
  forced_posture, all FACILITY_FLAGS) and the real `_scene_suspension` method. arrival → bound →
  after. State-aware (nugget needs no limb-cuffs / little / preg slung clear of the belly),
  kit-aware (pierced rings clipped into the frame; milk-port unlocks a hung-and-milked option).
  §0 lit hard: the steel is rated to hold a thrashing body all day AND to let go the instant the
  word is meant — "both at once; the only kind of rig worth trusting."
- ✅ **Bethany's Long Night (`bn_*`, `scene longnight`/night)** — BUILT. The savor-piece, the
  densest scene in the build: her triple facility-bred cock taken slow and whole over a whole
  night — the three stallion-flared heads seated one by one, the three hound-knots forced in with
  a *pop* and locked, the bulging belly, fucked past consciousness and waking still impaled and
  being bred, the laced DEVOTION load. Five beats (arrival→seat→knot→dark→after). Real
  `bethany_breeds` (holes=3 + devotion) fires at the knot and dark beats + deepen/devote.
  State-aware (preg = bred-again over the swell), kit-aware (gape takes the flares easy). §0 lit
  even here: a `the_word_knot` branch ends it instantly even knotted three ways (engine-verified
  clean) — "the knots hold against the world, never against you; the deeper I have you, the more
  carefully I hold the door." Surfaces in the hub once Bethany owns you.
- ✅ **The Take / CNC (`cn_*`, `scene cnc`/take/hunt)** — BUILT. Core-list consensual-non-consent,
  written as the scene where the §0 floor stops being mere safety and becomes the literal enabling
  beam: Bethany names BOTH lines explicitly up front — in-fiction your "no" is hers to ignore (the
  negotiated game), the OOC word is the one thing that always, instantly, un-grudgingly stops
  everything. frame → take → after. A `test_word` branch lets you prove the word stops her on a
  dime before anything begins; the `the_word` option at the take beat ENDS the scene mid-stream
  (engine-verified: clears pending + flags, no cn_after). The aftercare beat names the thesis out
  loud — "the cage is only as deep as the key is sure; the dread and the safety are married." Real
  deny_hold / facility _scene_single / devote.
- ✅ **The Wet Room / watersports (`ws_*`, `scene watersports`/wetroom/toilet/urinal)** — BUILT.
  Core-list watersports: kept as the facility's relief — urinal, drinking-station, golden-shower
  stock, bladder held full and ignored. Routes through REAL methods via the facility effect:
  `_toilet` (kind=gang — real urine to the fluid bank + bladder backing + filth marks) and
  `_scene_golden` (kind=scene), plus the real `filth` effect on close. arrival → use → after.
  State-aware (nugget perfect fixture / little wet-and-ashamed / preg still used). §0 lit hard: the
  trough holds for the facility, never against you — the word unfixes you and stands you up clean.
- ✅ **The Filling Station / cumflation (`cf_*`, `scene cumflation`/filling/pump)** — BUILT.
  Core-list cumflation: pumped/bred past full at a dedicated station to a litre-mark, then plugged
  to HOLD it — round, drum-tight, sloshing. Routes through the REAL inflation system via a new
  `go_cumflate` effect (add_inflation_volume bloats the inflatable zones the facility installs at
  intake + feeds the installed WombRoom; drained by tick AND the §0 reset, so never permanent).
  arrival → fill → held. State-aware (preg = filled over the get and faster; nugget tank; little),
  kit-aware (gape seats the plug easy; milk-port unlocks a "filled-and-milked closed loop" option).
  §0 lit hard: the plug holds for the facility but never against you — the word pops it and drains
  you free the instant you mean it.
- ✅ **The Doll Cabinet / dollification (`dl_*`, `scene doll`/dollify/cabinet)** — BUILT.
  Core-list dollification: sealed smooth into a latex/doll shell, made featureless and posable,
  kept and displayed as an OBJECT. Routes through a new `go_doll` effect (latex_sealed + optional
  sensory_hood + a posable posture — all FACILITY_FLAGS, floor-cleared). arrival → seal →
  displayed. State-aware (nugget already objectified, little a kept dolly, preg a display piece),
  kit-aware (already-sealed reads as a tighter *setting*). The seal-aware branch traps the person
  awake behind the smooth ("crueler — I like crueler"). §0 lit hard: the word splits the shell and
  stands you up a wanting person the instant you mean it — "a doll that chose to be mine."
- ✅ **The Kennel / petplay (`kn_*`, `scene kennel`/pet/puppy/petplay)** — BUILT. Core-list
  petplay: you ARE the pet (collared, crawling, named to a pet, trained, kept) — distinct from
  the Pens (bred BY animals). Routes through the REAL conditioning pet-imprint via a new `go_pet`
  effect (pet_type + pet_trigger_sources + forced_posture/body_language — all FACILITY_FLAGS, so
  the floor clears every bit). arrival → train → kept. State-aware (nugget = limbless lap-pet,
  little = already half-there, preg = bred bitch); kit-aware (already-collared reads). The
  warm-ownership branch lets you be *hers* specifically. §0 lit hard: the kept beat has Bethany
  state plainly the word stands you up a person any second, never held against you — "a pet by
  choice, not a thing I caught."
- ✅ **The Accounting (`iv_*`, `scene accounting`/inventory/stock/file)** — BUILT. The
  combination payoff: Bethany takes possessive personal stock of what she's MADE, the ledger
  GENERATED LIVE from your actual `_kit` + state (`_kit_ledger` composes every piercing / port /
  gape / brand / collar / clause + little/preg/nugget into one read-back). Distinct from Records
  (institutional grade) — this is intimate ownership. A bare body reads as a blank file with room
  to write; the addition beat reaches combination-aware for the next missing line (ring → port →
  collar → brand → "finished work"). §0 lit hard: the floor-ask branch has Bethany state plainly
  that one word wipes the whole file, instantly, never gated — "that's what makes the rest fair."

---

## C. THE CONNECTIVE LAYER (replaces the blind room-cycle) — ✅ BUILT (core)
- ✅ **Scene-flow hub** (`facility_hub`, `whereto`/`route`): between scenes you're routed by
  CHOICE, not a clock. State-aware menu (only what fits your standing shows; office/seraphine
  gate on ownership), each option launches a real scene; "let the board decide" routes at random.
- ✅ **`scenemode on/off`** toggle: an opt-in early-return guard on BOTH cycle `at_repeat`s
  (FacilityScript + RealmCycleScript). ON = the narrative timer-cycle stops auto-advancing /
  dragging you room to room; you drive via `scene`/`whereto`; machines, milking sessions, arousal
  and engorgement keep ticking on their own scripts. Default OFF (safe) — flip live to test.
  §0 floor untouched either way.
- ✅ **Auto-hub on close**: with `scenemode on` (sets `scene_autohub`), a scene's `end` auto-poses
  the facility hub — handoff is seamless, no manual `whereto`.
- TODO (polish): verify under `scenemode on` that milking still INITIATES via the Dairy scene
  (the old cycle was one initiator) — hand-test in-game.

## Build order (suggested, after Intake)
1. ✅ **Breeding Pens** (stockman + studs) — DONE. Next:
2. ✅ **Conditioning Cell** — DONE.
3. ✅ **Dairy** — DONE (the scene→cycle seam + the state-aware hook pattern).
4. ✅ **Marking Parlour** + ✅ **Sanitation/Pigsty** — DONE. Next:
5. ✅ **Showroom** + ✅ **Office/Kept** — DONE (ownership through-line complete). Next:
6. ✅ ALL 14 ROOMS BUILT (Nursery/Deep Stock/Holding/Floor/**Records** done). Remaining: **Events**, then the flow controller.
